Step Probability Switches (8 total):
Set the probability for each step individually. Each switch has three positions:

Off (step will never trigger)
Variable (step will trigger based on the Probability knob setting)
100% (step will always trigger)
Probability Knob:
Sets the variable probability for any steps with their switch in position 2 (Variable). Turning the knob clockwise increases the chance that those steps will trigger.

Mute Button:
Toggles mute on and off. When held, the Probability knob is used to set the sequence length.

Clock In Jack:
Accepts any signal above 1V to advance the sequencer to the next step.

Reset In Jack:
Queues up the next clock pulse to return the sequence to step 1. For best synchronization, connect this input to the "transport STOP" output of your DAW or sequencer.

Gate Out Jack:
Outputs a gate signal for each active step, based on the probability settings and current sequence position. When a step is active, the clock input signal is buffered and sent to the gate output—so the output gate’s pulse width matches the incoming clock pulse width.

Chaining Multiple Modules:
The Iris 1 features two 3-pin connectors at the top of the module’s back panel for chaining clock and reset signals between multiple units. Connect a cable from the right connector (when viewing the module from the front) of one module to the left connector of the next module. This allows clock and reset signals to be passed, keeping multiple Iris 1 modules synchronized.
